# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates (Project Chimera Factory - minimal required checks):

- `SPEC-CENTRICITY`: Confirm `/specs/[###-feature]/functional.md` and `/specs/[###-feature]/technical.md` exist and define
  acceptance criteria and data schemas.
- `SWARM_TOPOLOGY`: Plan MUST declare the Planner, Worker, and Judge roles for the feature and identify which tasks are executed by
  stateless Workers and which validations are performed by Judges.
- `ARCHITECTURAL_ABSTRACTION`: Any external platform integration listed in the plan MUST reference an MCP adapter and NOT describe
  direct API calls from Worker logic.
- `ECONOMIC_GOVERNANCE` (if influencers or payments involved): Plan MUST include wallet provisioning steps via Coinbase AgentKit and
  logging to the MCP "Sense" flight recorder.
- `PERSONA_INTEGRITY` (for influencer specs): Plan MUST reference the `SOUL.md` file and include acceptance tests that map to its rules.
- `PERSISTENCE`: Plan MUST reference the storage schema defined in `technical.md` and specify where metadata will be stored.

Document gate results explicitly in this section. Any gate failing MUST block Phase 0 research until remediated.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
