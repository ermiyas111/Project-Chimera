# Project Chimera — Autonomous Influencer Factory (Spec Meta)

## Vision

Build a repeatable Factory that can spawn and operate Autonomous AI Influencers for content discovery, creation, and engagement,
with economic autonomy and strict governance.

## Business models

- Digital Talent Agency: Operate influencers for clients and share revenue.  
- PaaS: Provide the Factory as a platform where customers configure `SOUL.md` and budgeted agents.

## Constraints

- Python + Docker + Makefile workflows.  
- PostgreSQL + pgvector for semantic metadata.  
- All external access must go through MCP adapters (Sense for finance).
